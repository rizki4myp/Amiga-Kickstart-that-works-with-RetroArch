1) Extract the zip file
2) Prepare your favorite tool to check MD5 checksums. Currently, RapidCRC works the best for me (https://rapidcrc.sourceforge.net/). But it's all up to you.
3) Check each file's MD5 checksums, Make sure the MD5 checksums is listed in https://github.com/libretro/libretro-uae/blob/master/README.md . (For example: 82a21c1890cae844b3df741f2762d48d)
4) Move the files into "RetroArch\system" folder .
